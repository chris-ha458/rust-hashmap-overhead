# Rust Hashmap Overhead

This repo contains some code that I used while preparing a blog post and
presentation about the overhead of Rust HashMaps (and BTreeMaps). It's probably
not going to be maintained, since it was a one-off as an experiment.

The code is licensed under the AGPL, and you can find information in [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
